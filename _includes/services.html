                        Inria-EVA is a leading research team in low-power wireless communications. The team is designing Tomorrow's Internet of (Important) Things and pushes the limits of low-power wireless mesh networking by applying them to critical applications such as industrial control loops, with harsh reliability, scalability, security and energy constraints. Grounded in real-world use cases and experimentation, EVA co-chairs the IETF 6TiSCH standardization working group, co-leads Berkeley's OpenWSN project.

                    <p class="text-muted">The Real-time Water Systems lab at the University of Michigan studies fundamental knowledge gaps in water resources through the use of novel tools, such as sensor networks, system theory and machine learning. Through a spectrum of applications, spanning from the water balance and water quality of the Great Lakes, all the way to the control of urban hydraulic systems, we are working to show that sensor-driven, real-time water systems have the potential to fundamentally revolutionize our study of the interaction between meteorology, hydrologic systems, and man-made infrastructure.</p>
